Welcome to the home of Jonas Rylund Glesaaen. I am currently a postdoctoral
researcher working on lattice QCD at Swansea university. Besides an interest in
physics I also spend a lot of my time on:

* Computer Science (CS)
* High Performance Computing (HPC)
* Machine Learning (ML)

My biggest passion project is utilising modern software design, industry grade
work flow and best practicesâ„¢ while developing academic software, as well as
spreading these methodologies to my colleagues and the community.

I am not exactly sure what this website will be used for. I made it because I
find creating websites fun, and thought it was about time I got my own.
Hopefully I will fill it with something that will be of interest to someone,
somewhere.
