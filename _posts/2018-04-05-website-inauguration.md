Hello to whomever might read this. This is (as is probably all too apparent) the
first post on my brand new homepage. This basically spurred out of the creation
of a separate web page of a separate project as I discovered how much fun making
these things actually are. Most important is probably the fact that I came
across this wonderful
[Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic), but
didn't have anything to apply it to.

I am still not sure what I will put here, but for the time being I plan to use
it for three things

1. As a personal blog where I ramble about random things that interest me.
   This is partially because I need writing practice, and partially because
   writing things down is a great way to think things through.

2. As a collection of tips, tricks, and a general outlet for technical- and
   programming related posts; such as vim configurations, C++ template
   metaprogramming and tikz figures, or whatever else has blown my mind at the
   time.

3. As a personal portfolio. In these modern Internet times it seems to be
   important to have a website showcasing ones work. Therefore I plan to keep an
   up to date CV here, as well as references to projects I feel are worth
   showing off.

So here is to this turning into something that is hopefully interesting to
someone, somewhere, and not just one of those rapidly abandoned projects.
